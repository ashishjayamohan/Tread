### What is Tread?
Tread is a data science package built in Python 3 that has functions that are useful for every data scientist.

### How do I work with Tread?
To get started with Tread, first ensure that your computer has Python installed. You can check this by typing `python --version` in your command line. Once you have Python installed, install pip (`pip install pip`) and instal MatPlotLib (`pip install matplotlib`). Now download the source code for this project on to your computer. You are now ready to start using Tread!

## Using Tread
Once you have installed the Tread project source code on your computer and downloaded all necessary components, simply import whichever function script you require and you can begin using all the functions that are in those function scripts. For a general overview of how this works, see `test_program.py` for an example usage of the `add` method from `basic_functions.py`.
